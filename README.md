# Nucloid kernel #

Nucloid is a simple monolithic kernel written in Rust currently targeting
x86-32 and x86-64; with intent to support AArch32 and AArch64.

Nucloid is highly experimental and still in its early stage of development,
use this code with caution. Documentation will come soon (we always say that).
